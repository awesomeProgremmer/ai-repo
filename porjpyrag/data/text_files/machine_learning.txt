Machine Learning Basics

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve 
from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing computer programs
that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

Types of Machine Learning:
1. Supervised Learning: Learning with labeled data
2. Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
